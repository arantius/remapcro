Errors/issues in first boards:

* The micro USB plug on the Arduino Pro Micro sits about 30mil proud of
  the female USB socket on the UHS mini.
* The seven pin board interconnect is misaligned.  It's aligned properly
  when the boards are both face up, but it's off center, so it's no longer
  aligned when the logic board is flipped into its final orientation.
* The RGB LED is indeed common cathode, so hooking it to +3v3 won't work.
* The RGB LED should be rotated 180 so the dimple fits into the matching slot
  of the key switch.
